While a virtual network is in use by a VM, it cannot be modified or deleted. <br/><br/>Currently, the only supported L2 type is VLAN. Each virtual network is bound to a single VLAN, and trunking VLANs to a virtual network is not supported. A virtual network on VLAN 66 would be named 'vlan.66'. Each virtual network maps to a hypervisor-specific default vswitch. On KVM, this is 'br0'. To use a different vswitch (e.g., with different uplinks), you can append the vswitch name to the network identifier. For example, 'vlan.66.br1'. This virtual switch should exists on all hosts, and the physical switch ports for the vswitch uplinks are properly configured to receive VLAN-tagged traffic. <br/><br/>On hypervisors where it is supported, a virtual network may have an IPv4 configuration. Such a network is a 'managed L3' network. A network without a IPv4 configuration is an 'unmanaged L3' network. A network must be configured as 'managed L3' or 'unmanaged L3' at creation time. It is not possible to convert one to the other. A particular L2 (i.e., a particular VLAN) may have at most one managed network defined at a time. <br/><br/>To create a managed network, the user specifies the 'ipConfig'. This consists of an IPv4 default gateway address and subnet in CIDR notation. The user may optionally specify a DHCP server address, to avoid conflict with other services on the network. By default, the last available host address in the subnet is used. Every virtual NIC on a managed network must be assigned an IPv4 address at NIC creation time. <br/><br/>All DHCP traffic on the network will be rerouted to an internal DHCP server, who hands out configured IPv4 addresses. DHCP traffic on the physical network will not reach the virtual network, and vice versa. A managed network may have zero or more non-overlapping DHCP pools. Each pool must be entirely contained within the network's managed subnet. In the absence of a DHCP pool, the user must specify an IPv4 address when creating a virtual network adapter (see POST /vms/nic_create). If the managed network has a DHCP pool, the user need not provide an address; the NIC will automatically be assigned an IPv4 address from one of the pools at creation time, provided at least one address is available. Addresses in the DHCP pool are not reserved. That is, a user may manually specify an address belonging to the pool when creating a virtual adapter.","type":"create.dto.acropolis.ReturnValueDTO$NetworkIdDTO","nickname":"createNetwork","parameters":[{"description":"Network config info","required":true,"allowMultiple":false,"paramType":"body","type":"create.dto.acropolis.NetworkConfigDTO"}],"responseMessages":[]}]},{"internal":false,"path":"/networks/{uuid}","operations":[{"deprecated":"false","internal":false,"method":"DELETE","summary":"Delete a network.","notes":"Delete a network. <br/><br/>A network cannot be deleted while Virtual Machines are still attached to it. <br/><br/>The logical timestamp can optionally be provided for consistency.
