## Writing the plugin's documentation

We use Antora to develop and build the documentation.
See the https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/[Antora documentation] for a brief overview on how to install and use Antora.
You can also refer to https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/write-the-docs/overview.html for details on how we develop our product documentation.

### Building the documentation

```
$ cd opennms-nutanix-plugin
$ antora generate local-site.yml
$ serve public
```
