## Deployment via KAR file

The installation of the plugin is simple.
Just copy the provided KAR file to your OpenNMS `deploy` directory.
The following example copies the KAR file `path/to/opennms-nutanix-plugin.kar` to the `deploy` directory assuming that OpenNMS is installed in `/opt/opennms`.

```
$ cp path/to/opennms-nutanix-plugin.kar /opt/opennms/deploy/
```

After this step you can install the plugin in the OpenNMS Karaf shell:

```
admin@opennms()> feature:install opennms-plugins-nutanix
```

After installation, Nutanix-specific Karaf commands are available to configure the plugin.

## Deploy from source

After checking out the repository, you can build and install the plugin into your local Maven repository using:

```
$ mvn clean install
```

NOTE: To speed up development iterations, use `-Dcodegen.skip=true` to skip the regeneration of the client model classes.

Now you can add the repository and install the feature in the OpenNMS Karaf shell.
Replace `<VERSION>` with the version you built and want to deploy.

```
admin@opennms()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.opennms.plugins.nutanix/karaf-features/<VERSION>/xml
admin@opennms()> feature:install opennms-plugins-nutanix
```

To ensure that the feature is activated on future service restarts, add the feature to a file in `featuresBoot.d`:

[source, shell]
echo "opennms-plugins-nutanix wait-for-kar=opennms-plugins-nutanix" | sudo tee ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/featuresBoot.d/plugin-nutanix.boot
