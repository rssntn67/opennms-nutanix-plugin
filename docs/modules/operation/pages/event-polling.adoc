= Events
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

After installation, the plugin starts to collect events for the configured connections.
These events will be associated with the corresponding entities in the OpenNMS system, using the following event definitions:
```
<events xmlns="http://xmlns.opennms.org/xsd/eventconf">
    <event>
        <uei>uei.opennms.org/vendor/nutanix/proxyEvents</uei>
        <event-label>Nutanix Proxy Event</event-label>
        <descr>A proxy event of type %parm[event]% was sent for gateway %nodelabel% (%nodeid%): '%parm[message]%'</descr>
        <logmsg dest="logndisplay">A proxy event of type %parm[event]% was sent for gateway %nodelabel% (%nodeid%): '%parm[message]%'</logmsg>
        <severity>Indeterminate</severity>
    </event>
</events>
```

The default polling interval is set to five minutes and can be modified by using the configuration property `events.delay`.
