# OpenNMS Nutanix Plugin


OpenNMS Nutanix plugin was generated by the OPA archetype.

The generated plugin contains code:
* Karaf Shell Command 
* REST Endpoint 
* Nutanix Event Configuration Extension 
* Alarm Lifecycle Listener 
* Nutanix Monitor 
* Nutanix Data Collection 
* Nutanix Provisioning Extension 



Build and install the plugin into your local Maven repository using:

```
mvn clean install
```
To speed up development iterations, one can use `-Dcodegen.skip=true` to skip the regeneration of the client model classes.


From the OpenNMS Karaf shell:
```
feature:repo-add mvn:org.opennms.plugins.nutanix/karaf-features/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/xml
feature:install opennms-plugins-nutanix
```


```
cp assembly/kar/target/opennms-nutanix-plugin.kar /opt/opennms/deploy/
feature:install opennms-plugins-nutanix
```

```
bundle:watch *
```

You can also access the REST endpoint mounted by the plugin at `http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/nutanix/`
